My current research focuses on representations of the American West in theme parks and pay equity in popular culture archives. My master’s thesis is about the representation of people and landscapes, and my master’s capstone is about predicting wait times for attractions. In the future, I hope to research diversity and storytelling in the themed experiences industry.

As a [career and life coach](https://www.teallegacies.com/), I love bringing my academic research to folks outside of academia. When I’m not researching or coaching, I love hanging out with my [dog](https://www.instagram.com/goodboishilling/) and playing Dungeons and Dragons.
