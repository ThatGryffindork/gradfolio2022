## Crowdsourced Data and Visualizing Theme Park Wait Times ##
If good things come to those who wait, then attractions at Walt Disney World must be very good things indeed since some attractions involve three-to-five hour waits. To optimize maximum ride time at theparks, TouringPlans offers a crowd-sourced service that calculates actual wait times. TouringPlans users have asked to accommodate rope drop times that start a few minutes before a park opens. In this capstone, we will visualize what it would mean to offer this service to the TouringPlans community. This study merges three TouringPlans datasets, two of which are interchangeable depending on the ride and park desired. The final visualization splits the data according to daily crowd density and Extra Magic Hours (EMH) when the parks are exclusively open to resort guests. Results suggest that wait times become increasingly scattered throughout the first hour regardless of crowd level during general entry, but generally hold steady during EMH.
